The Pros and Cons of participating in Make Something Cool Every Day:<br>
<br>
<a href="https://analog.smugmug.com/MSCED-2013/">Here</a>
 are all the pictures from the series.<br>
<br>
<h2>Pros</h2>
<li class=bullet1>You actually make something everyday.</li>
<li class=bullet1>Creativity begets creativity.</li>
<li class=bullet1>You finished something everyday.</li>
<li class=bullet1>You "think" you want to do something big (something that.ll take days/months/years) to complete, but do you really start it? or do you just procrastinate starting it? With MSCED, at least you get something done today.</li>
<li class=bullet1>You force yourself to make something everyday, and sometimes you come up with good ideas because of it, or you make some cool things on days when you would have rather just slept.</li>
<li class=bullet1>You improve/polish the skills you have.</li>
<li class=bullet1>It gets you going. While it does suck away at some time in your day, it also gets you in the making mood.</li>

<h2>Cons:</h2>
<li class=bullet1>You stay away from doing things that could take more than a day. (or you put them off so you can do the MSCED post first.) So instead of starting something big, or working on an ongoing project, you spend the morning working on MSCED.</li>
<li class=bullet1>You tend to avoid things you think may not turn out well. (avoiding new things.)</li>
<li class=bullet1>You tend to avoid things that don.t post well to the internet. (practicing the guitar doesn.t post well to the internet.)</li>
<li class=bullet1>You.ll post crap.</li>
<li class=bullet1>You fret about getting something made each day.</li>

<h2>Tips:</h2>
<li class=bullet1>Don't plan things, just go day to day. It might be good to have an idea, but usually these ideas get overthrown by something else.</li>
<li class=bullet1>MSCED is so you get better, don.t cheat. don.t make 4 variations of the same thing just so you can have 3 days off while you post things. If you don.t make it every day you are just cheating yourself; no one else cares.</li>
<li class=bullet1>If you made 2 cool things in one day, you made one thing for today, and still need to make something for tomorrow.</li>
<li class=bullet1>No one cares, don.t expect anyone to care, just do it because you want to.</li>
<li class=bullet1>Don't try to do any other daily challenges. Just stick to one. (don.t stop doing other stuff, just don.t sign up for a bunch of daily challenges.)</li>
<li class=bullet1>I didn.t do this, but I think it would have been better to be one day behind; Make something, but don.t post it until the next morning; give yourself time to look it over and pretty it up some more.</li>
<li class=bullet1>When you think you.re done, go for a walk (with a camera/notebook.) and then come back and see if you want to add anything. Walks are a good place to find textures (then again, so is google.images)</li>
<li class=bullet1>MEDIUMS! Branch out and try other mediums (most of my stuff was made in processing and inkscape ) There are so many mediums (infinite probably) to try. BUT if you happen to be doing this in a place that frowns on watching you finger paint, then just use what you are able to use.</li>
<li class=bullet1>Don't use flicker, tumblr, twitter, facebook as the master. Use something that allows you to post as many different types of formats as possible ( For example I posted in a lot of source code in my posts.) I started on flickr, but it was too limiting.</li>
<li class=bullet1>Most people are too lazy to click out of twitter/facebook , if you care if people actually look at your stuff, then you might want to include a version as a twitpic/facebook pic, because clicking on a link to your website is a lot of work for some people. See tip 2, this is for you, so who really cares.</li>
