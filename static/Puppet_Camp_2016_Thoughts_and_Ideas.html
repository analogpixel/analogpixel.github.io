    <div class=blogContent><p>These are my thoughts and musings from attending Puppet Camp Denver 2016. Not everything here was said directly during the talks.</p>
<h2 id="keynote-overview">Keynote Overview</h2>
<blockquote>
<p>you are either a software company or you are going out of business.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>Companies that ignore technology, will be replaced by companies that embrace technology.  People that don&#39;t automate their jobs, will be without jobs, because people at other companies are automating their work and moving ahead, while your troglodytes are sitting around doing the same manual work over and over; you can&#39;t innovate new ideas when you are stuck in the mud all day doing the same mundane tasks over and over.</p>
<p>People can only take you so far when you are automating your processes.  If your environment can&#39;t support automation, you are still stuck. This brings us to the next point, your infrastructure should be able to be completely defined in code.  This allows consistent and reliable builds every time you push our changes.  If your team is relying on a hundred page document to deploy machines, networks, or code, not only are you slow, but extremely prone to error, and that hundred page document can&#39;t be optimized in  a way that a programmed solution can, so if your automated solution runs in 20 minutes today, you can optimize parts of that optimizations and get the process down to 10 minutes, but with people, they&#39;ll probably only get slower over time as they come to hate doing that manual process over and over; we have computers for a reason, repetitive manual work is not one of them.</p>
<p>One final note about automating your infrastructure; don&#39;t implement tools that can&#39;t be automated, as they just create bottle necks in your environment.  If the current tool you are looking at doesn&#39;t have a <em>rich</em> api (notice rich) then look for a tool that does.  Don&#39;t take a vendor&#39;s word that there is an API, make sure you test it.  VMWARE has an API to allow you do to anything you want, but the interface his horrible to use unless you use another 3rd party library that may or may not be maintained.</p>
<p>Once you get all this automation in place, guess what, now you have free time, aren&#39;t working weekends, and will probably feel much more confident when you need to push changes to your environment.</p>
<p>I have some processes in my current environment that can&#39;t be automated (even worse is that the product supports automation, but the corporation turned it off.).  So I was thinking of ways around this mess, and what I came up with was creating resources in these products that can&#39;t be automated, and then placing those resources somewhere that they can be used by an automated process.  For example, let&#39;s say I need a dns name for my virtual machine, but the dns name at your company must be manually created, well then you create 10-20 dns names (manually) and keep that list next to the tool that automates your vm deployment, as your vm deployment process is deploying machine, it&#39;ll just pull from that list of pre-made dns names.</p>
<h2 id="chat-ops">Chat-ops</h2>
<p>Chat-ops should really be a bigger buzz-word than it is, because if done correctly it seems like an amazing technology.  Chat-ops is taking something like slack, and then hooking bots up to it that automate your environment. </p>
<p>This has many advantages:</p>
<ul>
<li>If you aren&#39;t around when something breaks, you can just fire up the slack app on your phone, and tell the bot to restart the server. </li>
<li>If you are troubleshooting and issue, and have everyone in a channel together, everyone gets to see what troubleshooting steps are happening through the bot.</li>
<li>You get a single place to kick off and monitor processes.</li>
</ul>
<p>Since the conference, I&#39;ve used <a href="https://howdy.ai/botkit/">botkit</a>  with my free slack account, to quickly create an interface that allows me to query virtual machines, and restart them.  All the code is mostly available out there, you just need to glue it together for your environment.</p>
<h2 id="brown-field-deployments">Brown-field deployments</h2>
<p>A brown field is an existing environment that is having puppet like automation applied to it.  During this talk the speaker covered using puppet&#39;s noop flag to deploy code to an unknown environment.  The only other thing you need is a way to collect the puppet runs from all your machines, so you audit what would have changed if you actually pushed the code.  Hopefully I have more on this later.</p>
<h2 id="automation-build-engine">Automation Build Engine</h2>
<p>Another Idea I had while sitting at the talk was to build a web service that allows pulling down configuration scripts quickly in the manner of:</p>
<pre><code class="lang-sh">curl autohost/?hostname=abc  | bash
</code></pre>
<p>This would come in very handy on first build processes, or common fixes that can&#39;t be pushed out via your CM tool.</p>
<p>The web service would keep a list of host names, and the configuration script that would be pushed down to it.  Or if I make it a tad smarter to take options, I can pass the hostname and a task to the web service, and then have the web service stitch together a script from a template for building a host with a specific hostname.</p>
<h2 id="puppet-and-amazon-ami-instances">Puppet and Amazon AMI instances</h2>
<p>If you are using Puppet to maintain your golden images on amazon, then the last step is to remove puppet from the machine.  If any changes are needed to the image, you update the image and re-deploy instead of pushing changes via puppet.  This gives you the advantage of speed of build, since you no longer need to build, then pull packages and configuration for every machine, and you get more consistency in your environment since if anyone has logged into a machine and manually installed anything, it&#39;ll get blown away when the new image is deployed.</p>
<h2 id="conclusion">Conclusion</h2>
<p>You just skipped to this part didn&#39;t you?  The overall theme is, automation and consistency; follow those two words or be out of of job in a few year, or watch as your company falls further and further behind the competition.  In the time it takes large companies to deploy a product or version (6-12months)  an entire new company can spring up and replace you, so either automate or you can wait around to be replaced.</p>
