<p><a href="https://projecteuler.net/">Project Euler</a> is a website that hosts programming/math challenge that get progressively harder as you move from problem to problem. The most common way of solving these problems is to pick your favorite language, solve the problem, and then move on to the next problem; quickly trying to get to those wonderful virtual trophies.</p>
<p>But looking at the first problem:</p>
<pre><code>If we list all the natural numbers below 10 that are multiples of 3 or 5, we get 3, 5, 6 and 9. The sum of these multiples is 23.

Find the sum of all the multiples of 3 or 5 below 1000.
</code></pre><p>If you solved this with your favorite language of choice, what have you really learned? And what exactly is the big rush to move on to the next problem anyways?</p>
<p>The Alternative</p>
<p>Alternatively, you could find other ways to solve the problem; while it still helps to solve the problem in a traditional way first (or not); don&#39;t stop after your initial solving attempt.</p>
<ul>
<li>Write a <a href="https://github.com/analogpixel/euler/blob/master/1/parser.txt">parser</a> to solve the problem and learn how to write a parser.</li>
<li>Write a <a href="https://github.com/analogpixel/euler/blob/master/1/circleDrag.html">custom Gui</a> to solve the problem and work on UI design; or learn how D3.js works.</li>
<li>Design a physical interface to solve the problem and work on mechanical design along with interacting a physical design with a computer.</li>
<li>What does a drum rhythm with different beats on multiples of 3, 5, and both send like? While it doesn&#39;t solve the problem, it does spring board you off into other directions of things to explore.</li>
<li>Learn verilog and create a circuit to solve the problem.
Attack the problem with this mindset; You are working for a company, and this &quot;problem&quot; is the core work the factory workers need to do every day. Your job is to design an interface to allow them to easily solve this type of problem and all you have to work with is a touch screen and a cpu (the rest needs to be designed by you.)</li>
</ul>
<p>Not only does solving the problem in this way give you a much deeper understanding of the problem, It also pushes you to learn new technologies and a somewhat practical uses for applying these new technologies.</p>
<h1 id="the-finished-problems">The &quot;finished&quot; problems</h1>
<p>Here are the problems I&#39;ve gone through so far.  My goal is to make it through at least the first 100 problems on project euler.</p>
<h3 id="-problem-1-https-projecteuler-net-problem-1-"><a href="https://projecteuler.net/problem=1">Problem 1</a></h3>
<p>The first thing I did was wrote a <a href="https://github.com/analogpixel/euler/tree/master/1/parser">simple parser</a> in <a href="http://pegjs.org/">PEG.js</a> to solve this type of problem.  I then took that parser and  used  <a href="https://d3js.org/">d3</a> to make a <a href="https://github.com/analogpixel/euler/tree/master/1/d3Gui">gui</a> to solve the problem.</p>
<p>Then I went in a different direction and used <a href="https://processing.org/">processing</a> to create an artistic <a href="https://github.com/analogpixel/euler/tree/master/1/s1">visualization</a> of the problem.</p>
<h3 id="-problem-2-https-projecteuler-net-problem-2-"><a href="https://projecteuler.net/problem=2">Problem 2</a> :</h3>
<p>In this problem, after solving it normally, I decided to create a visualization of the numbers using boxes.  Since I&#39;ve been taking a class on the <a href="http://www.hypeframework.org/">Hype</a> framework, I decided to use the feature that <a href="http://www.hypeframework.org/examples/HShapeLayout/example_001/index.html">maps objects to shapes</a>.  Although the Hype framework didn&#39;t work out well for this project and I ended up just using plain processing, I did end up reaching my end goal which can be found <a href="https://analog.smugmug.com/Digital-Sketches/Fibonacci/i-2zKSq9g">here</a>. The source to create the images can be found <a href="https://github.com/analogpixel/euler/tree/master/2/sk1">here</a>.</p>
